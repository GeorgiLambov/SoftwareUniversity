Each notification is added to a **queue**. (**Optional**)\n\nThe notifications can be positioned at the;\n**top** - **topLeft** - **topCenter** - **topRight** - **center** - **centerLeft** - **centerRight** - **bottom** - **bottomLeft** - **bottomCenter** - **bottomRight**\n\nThere are lots of other options in the API to customise the text, animation, speed, buttons and much more.\n\nIt also has various callbacks for the buttons, opening closing the notifications and queue control.\n\n***\n\n### Documentation\n\nDocumentation and examples are here: <http://needim.github.io/noty>\n\n***\n\n### Pull Requests\n\n1.

If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:\n\n   ```bash\n   git checkout master\n   git pull upstream master\n   ```\n\n3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch)\n   to contain your feature, change, or fix:\n\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>\n   ```\n\n4.
