			Etymology
	       
		   The word koala comes from the         Dharug gula. Although the vowel 'u' was originally 
		   written in the English orthography as "oo" (in spellings such as coola or koolah), it was changed to "oa", possibly in error. 
		   The word is mistakenly said to mean "doesn't drink".[4] 
		   Because of the koala's resemblance to a bear, 
		   it was often miscalled the koala bear, particularly by early settlers.[5]
		   Other names like monkey bear, native bear, and tree-bear have also been used.[4] 
		   Indigenous names include cullawine, koolawong, colah, karbor, colo, 
		   coolbun, boorabee, burroor, bangaroo, pucawan, banjorah, and burrenbong; many of these mean "no drink".[6] The generic name,
		   Phascolarctos, is derived from the Greek words phaskolos "pouch" and arktos "bear". The specific name, 
		   cinereus, is Latin for "ash coloured".
