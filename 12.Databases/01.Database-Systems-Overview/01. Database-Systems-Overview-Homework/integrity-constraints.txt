Integrity constraints ensure data integrity in the database tables
Enforce data rules which cannot be violated

Primary key constraint
Ensures that the primary key of a table has unique value for each table row

Unique key constraint
Ensures that all values in a certain column (or a group of columns) are unique

Foreign key constraint
Ensures that the value in given column is a key from another table

Check constraint
Ensures that values in a certain column meet some predefined condition


Constraints make it possible to further restrict the domain of an attribute. For instance, a constraint can restrict a given integer attribute to values
 between 1 and 10. Constraints provide one method of implementing business rules in the database. SQL implements constraint functionality in the form of
 check constraints. Constraints restrict the data that can be stored in relations. These are usually defined using expressions that result in a boolean
 value, indicating whether or not the data satisfies the constraint. Constraints can apply to single attributes, to a tuple (restricting combinations 
 of attributes) or to an entire relation. Since every attribute has an associated domain, there are constraints (domain constraints). The two principal
 rules for the relational model are known as entity integrity and referential integrity.
