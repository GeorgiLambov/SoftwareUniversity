Transactions are a sequence of database operations which are executed as a single unit:
Either all of them execute successfully
To provide reliable units of work that allow correct recovery from failures and keep a database consistent even in cases of system failure, 
when execution stops (completely or partially) and many operations upon a database remain uncompleted, with unclear status.

Or none of them is executed at all
To provide isolation between programs accessing a database concurrently. 
If this isolation is not provided, the program's outcome are possibly erroneous.

Example:
A bank transfer from one account into another (withdrawal + deposit)
If either the withdrawal or the deposit fails the entire operation should be cancelled


A database transaction, by definition, must be atomic, consistent, isolated and durable.
 Database practitioners often refer to these properties of database transactions using the acronym ACID.
