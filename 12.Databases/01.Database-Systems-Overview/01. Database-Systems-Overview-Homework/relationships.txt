Relationships between tables are based on interconnections: primary key / foreign key


Relationships have multiplicity:
One-to-many – e.g. country / towns
Relationship one-to-many (or many-to-one) – used often
A single record in the first table has many corresponding records in the second table


Self-Relationships
The primary / foreign key relationships can point to one and the same table

Many-to-many – e.g. student / course
Records in the first table have many corresponding records in the second one and vice versa
Implemented through additional table


One-to-one – e.g. example human / student
A single record in a table corresponds to a single record in the other table
Used to model inheritance between tables
