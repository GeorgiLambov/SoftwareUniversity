What is the primary key? 

 The primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each record in the table. It can either be a normal attribute that is guaranteed to be unique
 (such as Social Security Number in a table with no more than one record per person) or it can be generated by the DBMS (such as a globally unique identifier, 
 or GUID, in Microsoft SQL Server). Primary keys may consist of a single attribute or multiple attributes in combination.


What is the foreign key?

In the context of relational databases, a foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.
In simpler words, the foreign key is defined in a second table, but it refers to the primary key in the first table. 


What is the purpose of foreign keys? 

Since the purpose of the foreign key is to identify a particular row of the referenced table, it is generally required that the foreign key is equal 
to the candidate key in some row of the primary table, or else have no value (the NULL value). This rule is called a referential integrity constraint 
between the two tables. Because violations of these constraints can be the source of many database problems, most database management systems provide 
mechanisms to ensure that every non-null foreign key corresponds to a row of the referenced table.
