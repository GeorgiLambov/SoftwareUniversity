Structured Query Language (SQL)
is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS),
 or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

SQL consists of a data definition language and a data manipulation language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, 
 query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is,
 a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.
 SQL consists of:

DDL – Data Definition Language
CREATE, ALTER, DROP commands

DML – Data Manipulation Language
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE commands


Example of SQL SELECT query:

SELECT Towns.Name, Countries.Name
FROM Towns, Countries
WHERE Towns.CountryId = Countries.Id
